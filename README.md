# Half Finished Vehicles
 
This is just a Github of all of my Half Finished Vehicles ive had sitting on my hard drive. 

## THESE VEHICLES ARE UNFINISHED, MOST IF NOT ALL DO NOT HAVE EQUIPMENT INSIDE

1. Vehicles may have broken lights
2. Vehicles may only have minimal lighting
3. Most if not all vehicles do NOT have equipment inside the car
4. These are not available for support 

## While these vehicle are unfinished you CAN NOT do the following 

1. Unlock any of these vehicles
2. Rip any parts off of these vehicles
3. Reupload or claim these vehicles as your own
4. I ask that you do not share these files but instead link them to where they can download it ([Github](https://github.com/Officer-Pringle), [My Website](https://projekt-nightlight.com/), [Discord](https://discord.gg/BCJVeBQ))
